title: Write Jekyll posts in Markdown language
---


Here are some resources for helping you write post in Markdown language.

Most usefull will be the Chrome **Markdown editor** plugin. This also has an online editor at:

>[Online Markdown Editor from Pandao](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/ "Online Markdown Editor from Pandao").

You can also use online resources for editing your posts like this one:

>[Online Markdown Editor at dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/ "Online Markdown Editor at dillinger.io")

Or you can simplu edit the post in your [Github](http://github.com "Github") account and preview changes.

I just found about Github pages, Jekyll and Markdown language and I'm very thrilled how these work together for creating a simple blog.
